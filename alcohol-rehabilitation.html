            <p class=general-page-paragraph>
                Alcohol addiction is a common illness displayed in many different forms. Most alcoholics develop the illness over years of drinking, with their need for the substance rising as their tolerance increases. Many users maintain themselves for years, keeping their lives intact, with relationships and occupations hanging by a thread. Eventually the need for alcohol takes control of their lives, with bodily function dropping to an unmanageable level. The effects of alcoholism are physical, emotional, and social. The illness takes over the addict's life, health, family, and occupations.

                        Binge drinkers, who can go many days or weeks fighting a drink. Although once the urge
takes over, they go on benders, resulting in the user drinking uncontrollably.

                        Social, after-work drinkers who find themselves consuming more and more alcohol over
time to fulfill their growing tolerance.
