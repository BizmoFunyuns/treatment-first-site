                We have the vision to help treat addicts that use any of the broad spectrum of drugs, including prescription drugs, club drugs, cocaine, and heroin. Many addicts use and abuse multiple drugs, and need a specialized program that will support them correctly through detox. As any drug takes over the addicts life, the user can lose their life piece by piece. Family, home, and occupations get consumed by the addiction until their is nothing left. Physical well being drastically changes as consumption worsens, changes to the brain occur, respiratory failure, organ failure, and erratic behavioral outlashes on life around the addict. The negative effects of drug addiction hollows out an individual, and creates vast emptiness within a family.
